  col
from
  code_secret
where
  src = 'Detect AWS access key AKIA4YFAKEKEYXTDS252!'
```

## Developing

Clone:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/turbot/steampipe-plugin-code.git
cd steampipe-plugin-code

## Credits

* The `code_secret` table is based on [Yelp's detect secrets](https://github.com/Yelp/detect-secrets)
  project. The general matching approach and regular expressions are copied and
  based on their amazing work.
